# Shared profile resolution. SOURCE this, do not execute it.
#
# One knob activates a server: `SERVER_PROFILE=<name>` in .env. Everything that
# differs between boxes — GPU, engine, models, VRAM split, ports, which roles
# are served locally and which are delegated to a peer — lives in
# servers/server-<name>.env, which is committed. .env keeps only what is
# genuinely per-host: the profile name, secrets, and the peer address block
# (identical on every box, so it never needs editing).
#
# HOW THE LAYERING WORKS
#   docker compose --env-file servers/server-<name>.env --env-file .env
# Compose unions the keys of every --env-file and the LAST file wins on a
# conflict (verified on compose 5.1.4), so the profile supplies the defaults
# and .env overrides them. That ordering is the whole design: a profile can be
# committed and shared, while a host keeps its own secrets and any one-off
# override without editing a tracked file.
#
# WHY A HELPER RATHER THAN A COPIED .env
# The previous flow was `cp servers/server-x.env .env`, which forks the profile
# the moment anything is tuned: the box drifts from the committed profile and
# nothing can tell you how. Layering keeps the profile authoritative.
#
# ⚠️  A BARE `docker compose` COMMAND DOES NOT SEE THE PROFILE. It reads .env
# only, so every profile value falls back to its compose default. Use
# scripts/dc.sh (a thin wrapper that adds these flags) for ad-hoc commands:
#     scripts/dc.sh ps
#     scripts/dc.sh logs -f litellm

# Resolve repo root from THIS file, so a caller's cwd is irrelevant.
