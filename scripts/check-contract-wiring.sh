# Assert that every variable config/litellm/config.yaml reads is actually
# passed to the litellm container.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-09-10 config.yaml read twelve `os.environ/CONTRACT_*`
# variables and docker-compose.yml passed none of them. LiteLLM published all
# six contract aliases in /v1/models anyway, and every request to them failed —
# which from a consumer's side is indistinguishable from a healthy stack with a
# broken model.
#
# Nothing else catches this. deploy.sh's role guard checks the variables are set
# in the *shell*; it cannot know the container never received them.
# health-check.sh probes /v1/models, which lists the aliases whether or not they
# resolve. The two files simply drifted apart, and only a check that reads both
# can see it.
#
# The check is deliberately generic — it does not know what CONTRACT_ means. It
# extracts `os.environ/NAME` from the config and compares against the names the
# rendered compose passes to litellm, so it covers any future variable too.
#
# Usage:  scripts/check-contract-wiring.sh [--quiet]
# Exit:   0 = every referenced variable is forwarded
#         1 = at least one is not (names printed)
#         2 = could not run the check (missing file, compose render failed)
